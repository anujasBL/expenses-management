## Parallelization Opportunities

### High Parallelization (Can be developed simultaneously):

- Add New Expense + View Expense List + Basic Categories
- Local Storage + Basic Spending Summary
- Search and Filter + Category Breakdown
- Responsive Design + other features

### Sequential Dependencies:

- View Expense List depends on Add New Expense
- Basic Spending Summary depends on Local Storage
- Category Breakdown depends on Basic Spending Summary
- All features depend on Basic Categories

### Risk Mitigation:

- Start with core functionality (Add/View expenses)
- Implement Local Storage early to prevent data loss
- Test incrementally to catch issues early
- Have backup plan for complex features (Category Breakdown, Search/Filter)

---

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria:

- Users can add and view expenses
- Data persists between sessions
- Basic spending insights are displayed
- Application is responsive and deployed
- All core user stories are functional

### Stretch Goals (if time permits):

- Category Breakdown visualization
- Search and Filter functionality
- Export/Import data feature
- Advanced analytics (trends, comparisons)

---

## Technical Considerations

### Recommended Tech Stack:

- **Frontend**: React (create-react-app for speed)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for rapid UI development
- **Storage**: localStorage for simplicity, IndexedDB for larger datasets
- **Charts**: Chart.js or Recharts for data visualization
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages for quick deployment

### Development Environment:

- Use pre-built components and libraries
- Implement feature flags for incremental delivery
- Focus on functionality over perfect styling
- Use existing design systems and templates

### Testing Strategy:

- Manual testing for core user flows
- Automated testing for critical functions (if time permits)
- Cross-browser testing on major browsers
- Mobile device testing
